## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Modal doesn't open
- **Cause**: Missing appointment ID or patient ID
- **Check**: Console logs for appointment data structure
- **Fix**: Verify appointment object has proper ID fields

### Issue 2: Patient details don't load
- **Cause**: Invalid patient ID or API endpoint issue
- **Check**: Network tab for API call status
- **Fix**: Verify backend endpoint is working

### Issue 3: Actions fail silently
- **Cause**: Token expiration or insufficient permissions
- **Check**: Authentication status and token validity
- **Fix**: Re-login or check backend permissions

### Issue 4: List doesn't refresh after action
- **Cause**: Missing callback or state update
- **Check**: `onAppointmentUpdated` callback is called
- **Fix**: Verify modal calls the callback on success

## 📊 Debug Console Commands

While debugging, you can run these in the console:

```javascript
// Run full system diagnostic
debugAppointmentManagement()

// Get current appointment status
getCurrentAppointmentStatus()

// Test specific action
testAppointmentAction('appointmentId', 'accept')

// Check component imports
runAppointmentTests()
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The system is working correctly when:

- ✅ Accept/Cancel/Complete buttons work as expected
- ✅ Appointment status updates in real-time
- ✅ Error handling works gracefully
- ✅ No console errors or crashes

## 🚀 Production Readiness

Before going live:
- 🔒 Disable debug mode (`debugMode: false`)
- 🧹 Remove debug panel code if not needed
- 🔍 Test with real appointment data
- 📱 Test on different device sizes
- 🌐 Verify all API endpoints are production-ready
- 🔐 Confirm proper authentication and authorization
